# Snake (Multiplayer) üêç
A step beyond reviving old-school classics. Snake is an old-school computer game with a premise of a snake controlled by the user with a goal of consuming as many apples as possible. Now, this is a modern take on snake with a twist... MULTIPLAYER GAMEPLAY!

## Synchronization & Threading in Snake Multiplayer
Old versions of Snake uses sequential where the flow is sequenced as:

        Snake -> Apple -> Register Score -> Allow Snake to Move

However, this modern take on Snake utilizes synchronization to allow two snakes/ multiple threads to move simultaneously whilst having all other elements occur and function alongside each other.
